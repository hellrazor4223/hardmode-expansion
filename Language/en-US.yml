#BEGIN BRIEFINGS
  STR_INITIAL_BRIEFING: "Initial Briefing"
  STR_INITIAL_BRIEFING_UFOPEDIA: "It is 1999 and Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) have started appearing with disturbing regularity in the night skies.{NEWLINE}The reports of violent human abductions and horrific experimentation struck terror into the hearts of millions as documented cases of human abductions by UFOs become commonplace in areas of sparse population in countries throughout the world.{NEWLINE}The mass public hysteria has only served to expose Earth's impotence against a vastly superior technology. In response world governments step up their military readiness, and there is a general news blackout in most of the affected countries. Scientists try to make contact with the aliens, but there is no substantial response."

  STR_KIRYU_KAI: "The Kiryu-Kai"
  STR_KIRYU_KAI_UFOPEDIA: "Many countries begin to contemplate a direct military strike against the invaders and initially attempted to deal independently with the aliens. In August 1998, Japan established an anti-alien combat force - the Kiryu-Kai. Equipped with Japanese-made fighter aircraft, the Kiryu-Kai certainly looked like a powerful force. However, after 5 months of expensive operations they had yet to intercept their first UFO.{NEWLINE}The lesson was clear - this was a worldwide problem which could not be dealt with by individual countries."

  STR_EXTRATERRESTRIAL_COMBAT_UNIT: "X-Com"
  STR_EXTRATERRESTRIAL_COMBAT_UNIT_UFOPEDIA: "On December 11, 1998, representatives from the world's most economically powerful countries gathered secretly in Geneva. After much debate, the decision was made to establish a covert independent body to combat, investigate and defeat the alien threat. This organization would be equipped with the world's finest pilots, soldiers, scientists and engineers, working together as one multi-national force.{NEWLINE}This organization was named the Extraterrestrial Combat Unit or in short form X-Com."

  STR_SOLDIER_ARMOR_REPAIR: "Soldier Armor Repair"
  STR_SOLDIER_ARMOR_REPAIR_UFOPEDIA: "Since we are running on a tight budget, it is imperative that we keep all armors our soldiers can wear in top shape. Procedures for repairing soldier armor has been put into action, as long as the corpses of those unfortunate to die from alien hands can be recovered."

  STR_TANK_REPAIR: "HWP Repair"
  STR_TANK_REPAIR_UFOPEDIA: "After initial debate between our scientific staff and our lead engineer we decided to enact procedures to repair any destroyed HWP's as long as their remains were recovered completly from a successful groundbattle mission. The repair cost of the units are roughly 50% of there initial production cost."

  STR_SUPPORT_DRONES: "Support Drones"
  STR_SUPPORT_DRONES_UFOPAEDIA: "Compared with our first designs regarding automated heavy weapon platforms, these small robots aim for another goal on the battlefield. Reconnassaince and indirect troop support. They features a slick design and comprehensive armor, for their size. Intelligence gathering on the battlefield, will increase the battle capability of our troops greatly and will help us decrease our losses. Our engineers speculate that we can even equip them with some scanners or medical equipment."

  STR_EXPLOSIVE_AMMO: "Explosive Ammo"
  STR_EXPLOSIVE_AMMO_UFOPEDIA: "Our advanced infantry weapons, the Heavy Cannon and the Auto Cannon can now also fire explosive rounds, which do HE damage. We have supplied our main weapon contractor with the plans and scematics to make this kind of ammo."

  STR_ALLOY_AMMO: "Alien Alloy Ammunition"
  STR_ALLOY_AMMO_UFOPEDIA: "With the knowledge of how to process the ultra-strong yet lightweight alien alloys, we can now manufacture alloy bullets capable of withstanding higher muzzle velocities without disintegrating, fired from alloy casings that are lighter yet stronger than previously possible."

  STR_ALLOY_AIRFRAME: "Alien Alloy Airframe"
  STR_ALLOY_AIRFRAME_UFOPEDIA: "With our now basic understanding on how to shape and form the newly discovered Alien Alloys, we might be able to produce new improved airframes for our interceptors. It is even suspected that we may improve our troops transporters, once initial testing with the enhanced Airframes have been conducted."

  STR_ALLOY_TANK_ARMOR: "Alloy HWP Armor"
  STR_ALLOY_TANK_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "The great success, we achieved with improving our air interception and air transport capabilities with Alien Alloys, was giving one of our engineering teams some great ideas on how to apply this new knowledge to our Heavy Weapon Platforms. After some initial research, we were able to enhance the armor and speed of them, using Alien Alloys. As a side effect our targetting modules could be increased, resulting in better aim and reactions for the Heavy Weapon Platforms."

  STR_ALLOY_DRONE_ARMOR: "Alloy Drone Armor"
  STR_ALLOY_DRONE_ARMOR_UFOPAEDIA: "Our engineers finally found a way to enhance our working procedures with alien alloys, to such a degree, that we are now able to produce our drones with an alloy armor. This will greatly increase their armor, speed and durability on the battlefield. We also were able to increase the intensity and capacity of each of the supplemental equipment. The drone scanner, medikit and taser now take less time to be operated in the field and also hold more charges. We hope that this advancement will allow to reduce our big casuality numbers further."

  STR_LASER_WEAPONS: "Laser Weapons"
  STR_LASER_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "Lasers have been known for decades. The discovery of alien alloys  and  the information about optics found in the alien data slate, allows mankind now for the first time to design practical laser weaponry. It is in most ways superior to kinetic weapons, and will help our troops in combat against the aliens."

  STR_HOVERTANK: "Hovering HWP's"
  STR_HOVERTANK_UFOPEDIA: "After we now successfully replicated the core design of how the alien crafts work, our research and engineering team started at the adaptation of these new technologies to our Heavy Weapon Platforms. The result allow us now to build flying Heavy Weapon Platforms, granting those higher mobility, enhanced scouting and target acquisition capabilities."

They are the fittest brightest and most dangerous enemy we faced so far. The original tribal nature of the mutons seems to be manifesting in these elites, since they seem to go through a long selection process and only the fittest and brightest can call themselve members of the elites."
  STR_MUTON_ELITE_CORPSE: "Muton Elite Corpse"
  STR_MUTON_ELITE_AUTOPSY: "Muton Elite autopsy"
  STR_MUTON_ELITE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This specimen is identically to normal Mutons, but has undergone severe changes. Especially the armor has been significantly improved, also more implants for enemy tracking and more survival ability."

  STR_MUTON_ELITE_GUARD_ENGINEER: "Muton Elite Guard Engineer"
  STR_MUTON_ELITE_GUARD_LEADER: "Muton Elite Guard Leader"
  STR_MUTON_ELITE_GUARD_UFOPEDIA: "The elite of elite, the strongest and thoughest and brightest warriors of the Muton race seem to get granted with a special position in the Starspawn, they possess a significant resistence towards psionic influences and it is yet unknown how their Ethereal masters keep them under control. We suspect some sort of loyality indoctrination or a form of drug to keep them obedient."
  STR_MUTON_ELITE_GUARD_CORPSE: "Muton Elite Guard Corpse"
  STR_MUTON_ELITE_GUARD_AUTOPSY: "Muton Elite Guard autopsy"
  STR_MUTON_ELITE_GUARD_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This creatures body shows a lot of battlescars and a lot of additional cybernetic implants, we also found signs of a strange form of drug in the bloodstream, it seems to instill total obedience and further testing has proven that several core body functions are starting to shut down if the druglevel in the bloodstream falls under a certain level. The outer skin is more a combat suit then a skin, highly resistant to laser, plasma and high explosive damage, it can be compared to our power suits."
  
  STR_MUTON_BERSERKER: "Muton Berserker"
  STR_MUTON_BERSERKER_TERRORIST: "Muton Berserker Terrorist"
  STR_MUTON_BERSERKER_UFOPEDIA: "This hulking creature appears to be a subspecies of the Muton. It's much the same as the 'standard' variety, though overactive glands presumed similar to adrenal glands constantly flood its system with a hormone that keeps the creature in a constant state of rage, dulling its senses and giving it remarkable pain resistance. Its intelligence is sharply reduced compared to that of a standard Muton, so it seems to attack exclusively in close quarters."
  STR_MUTON_BERSERKER_CORPSE: "Muton Berserker Corpse"
  STR_MUTON_BERSERKER_AUTOPSY: "Muton Berserker autopsy"
  STR_MUTON_BERSERKER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Our initial findings shed a really dreadfull light on this creature. It is in its purest form a Muton, we only could identify really small changes in its genetic structure, mainly enforcing induced hormone levels to enrage it basically permanently. The induced pain reception and slightly hardened outer skin, allow significant damage reduction from all weapons."

  STR_CYBERMITE: "Cybermite"
  STR_CYBERMITE_TERRORIST: "Cybermite Terrorist"
  STR_CYBERMITE_CORPSE: "Cybermite Corpse"
  STR_CYBERMITE_UFOPEDIA: "This miniature robot is an automated terror weapon and represents the pinnacle of the alien robotics. As soon as the powerful optical sensor spots a target, the creature runs to it and attacks. The miniaturized elerium core is set to ignite and explode once damaged enough, making the act of killing the creature deadly for anyone nearby."
  STR_CYBERMITE_AUTOPSY: "Cybermite autopsy"
  STR_CYBERMITE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The most prominent feature of incredibly complex robot is its weapon, an alloy sting linked to a miniaturized tank which, from the traces found, is presumably filled with a potent toxin. The power core is too damaged to be fully understood but it seems to be designed to be very susceptible to damage and its likely this will cause it to explode."

  STR_HOLODRONE: "Holodrone"
  STR_HOLODRONE_TERRORIST: "Holodrone Terrorist"
  STR_HOLODRONE_UFOPEDIA: "Holodrones are living, floating, artillery weapons. They are protected by plasma a bubble that interferes with plasma attacks and fire. It could be that they were developed specifically to fight plasma-equipped enemies. The mechanism runs too hot and radioactive to be applied to a human armor."
  STR_HOLODRONE_CORPSE: "Holodrone Corpse"
  STR_HOLODRONE_AUTOPSY: "Holodrone autopsy"
  STR_HOLODRONE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "A very complex automaton powered by a massive, for its size, elerium core. Two shafts stretch from this core and are used to spread the plasma bubble that envelops the creature. It is also evident that the core can overcharge and collect this extra energy to generate a powerful laser beam."

  STR_ARMORED_CYBERDISC: "Armored Cyberdisc"
  STR_ARMORED_CYBERDISC_TERRORIST: "Armored Cyberdisc Terrorist"
  STR_ARMORED_CYBERDISC_UFOPEDIA: "This seems to be a upgraded version of the priviously encountered Cyberdisc, which we have faced in some serious fights. It's weapon was upgraded and is now capable of autofire."

  STR_ARMORED_SECTOPOD_AUTOPSY: "Armored Sectopod autopsy"
  STR_ARMORED_SECTOPOD_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This Sectopods armor was improved, to make it more resistant against Laser Weapons, Stun Weapons and High explosives, it now is a really significant threat on the battlefield. Featuring a modified Heavy Plasma as its main cannon it can fire autobursts with 5 shots. Our best chance in destroying those hulking deathmachines seems to be either melee combat or a flanking attempt, since the front armor is nearly impenetrable."

  STR_CHRYSSALID_SPITTER: "Chryssalid Spitter"
  STR_CHRYSSALID_SPITTER_TERRORIST: "Chryssalid Spitter Terrorist"
  STR_CHRYSSALID_SPITTER_UFOPEDIA: "This creature resembles an evolved Chryssalid. It retains the claws of its cousins, but also has the ability to spit its eggs quite a long way. It appears that the eggs are propelled by an extremely strong acid capable of eating through alien alloys."
  STR_CHRYSSALID_SPITTER_CORPSE: "Chryssalid Spitter Corpse"
  STR_CHRYSSALID_SPITTER_AUTOPSY: "Chryssalid Spitter Autopsy"
  STR_CHRYSSALID_SPITTER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This strange creature appears to be a more deadly variant of the Chryssalid species. A membranous sac located within the cloaca produces an acidic compound, and provides pressure to eject the eggs at a high velocity to penetrate armour. With the help of the acid, this creature can implant victims from quite long ranges. It seems this creature was designed to infect large proportions of population in an even faster time."

  STR_THE_ALIEN_THREAT: "The Alien Threat"
  STR_THE_ALIEN_THREAT_UFOPEDIA: "As stated in the initial X-Com briefing, it is imperative that we investigate all ongoing alien activities and find out what their purpose is. We do not know  what they want from us, but reports have been brought in from the civilian, the scientific and the military sector, which do not suggest peaceful intentions.{NEWLINE}Sighted cattle mutilations in agrarian areas as well as crop circles indicate a growing alien activity. We hope that this will not lead to any major panics if the aliens step up there activity even further.{NEWLINE}There also have been reports from all over the planet, which indicate the abduction of humans and possible experimentation on them. This is highly disturbing and may cause mass hysteria and mass panic, if not prevented."

  STR_ALIEN_INVASION: "Alien Invasion"
  STR_ALIEN_INVASION_UFOPEDIA: "After examining all of the data of the recovered Alien Data Slate and in conclusion with the interrogation of our prisoners, we can now be sure what the purpose of the alien arrival on Earth is. We strongly believe that a full scale alien invasion is the purpose of the starspawns arrival on Earth.{NEWLINE}To get further information on their tactics, strategies and technology, we need to know more. Our science division suggest that we capture more aliens alive and interrogate them. Preferential would be specimen which are familar with their technology, weaponry and operations. We assume, that the larger UFOs probably contain at least one Alien leader."

  STR_ALIEN_ORIGINS_UFOPEDIA: "It is clear that we are fighting a losing battle on Earth.  The alien hordes are overwhelming in number.  The best we can do is slow down their progress.  The only hope for humanity is to tackle the aliens at their source.  Our research seems to indicate a nearby base of operations within our solar system.  Aliens indicate this place to be the center of an ancient civilization that pre-dates human history.  We must locate this place as soon as possible.  However, we need to capture and interrogate an alien commander to gain more detailed information. Alien Bases seem to be the only place were alien commanders can be found."

  STR_THE_MARTIAN_SOLUTION_UFOPEDIA: "Our research now points to Mars as the base of alien operations.  The base is well hidden, and contains all the manufacturing and cloning facilities to fuel the infiltration of Earth.  It also seems to contain a controlling computer of some kind that controls the whole operation.  It seems that the hive-like alien society has some kind of 'queen bee'.  This is their fundamental weakness - if we can eliminate the 'brain' then the body will die.  We must step up our research efforts before it is too late.  In order to progress we must capture the highest ranking aliens - the Ethereal commanders - which only reside in alien bases of the Ethereal race."

  STR_PLASMA_WEAPONS: "Alien Plasma Weapons"
  STR_PLASMA_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "The initial thesis of how these weapons work are now confirmed. The information provided and extracted from the Alien Data Core will enable us to examine those weapons and finally understand their basic functions. Further research is needed and also someone who is able to explain the adjustment to the weapons powersystems and Earths gravity field. Plasma Weaponry the aliens use in combat are extremly deadly."

  STR_LAUNCHER_WEAPONS: "Alien Launcher Weapons"
  STR_LAUNCHER_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "The aliens seem to be deploying some kind of launcher weaponry which is pretty familar to our own rocket launchers. We need to get more information about these effective weapon systems from interrogations and the Alien Data Core."

  STR_ALIEN_BIOLOGY: "Alien Biology"    
  STR_ALIEN_BIOLOGY_UFOPEDIA: "The alien DNA has some remarkable similarities on some points with our own, despite of that the level of genetic structure suggest that it is very old, definitly older than our own. Moreover, certain fragments seem to have been added artificially, probably extracted from Earth organisms. Our presumption is that this is some kind of environment adaptation on a genetic level. The immunology seems to be pretty weak, therefore it is critical that we establish how they feed themselves and how their reproductive cycle works, so we can house them properly for interrogations. A larger alien installations may provide answers."

  STR_ALIEN_LANGUAGE: "Alien Language"
  STR_ALIEN_LANGUAGE_UFOPEDIA: "The decoding of the alien language was more than a challenge for a group of our best scientists and hackers. It seems to be a mixture of at least 7 original languages merged together over a long period of time. With this basic knowledge now in our hands, we should start investigating the computerlike devices we found in the UFOs. A alien prisoner familar with those devices explaining the basic functions is needed."

  STR_ALIEN_POWER_SYSTEMS: "Alien Power Systems"
  STR_ALIEN_POWER_SYSTEMS_UFOPEDIA: "It is a mystery for as so far how the aliens are able to generate power out of the newly discovered element Elerium-115. We suspect that the cylindrical shaped devices we found in the UFO's are their power sources, consuming Elerium-115 as fuel. A alive alien explaining the basic functions of those devices is required to progress further."

  STR_PSIONICS: "Psionics"
  STR_PSIONICS_UFOPEDIA: "Some of the aliens seem to possess some kind of psychic powers. The ability to use these psychic powers, to put another individium either in a state of constant fear, or taking over it's thought processes completly is a really terrible perspective indeed. We have witnessed these powers being used against us, but in time we may find a way to use this to our own advantage. To find a way to access the human psionic potential a facility is needed, interrogating prisoners may provide the technical and medical specifications we seek."

  STR_UFO_CONSTRUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "Alien craft consist of three main components - a power source, a navigation system and a hull built from alien alloys. The hull is specially designed to allow gravity waves to be directed and controlled. In addition a small quantity of Elerium is required to fuel the power source. Once the principles of construction are understood, and the functions of each component are known, then it is possible to build these types of craft, to achieve this, we need to interrogate prisoners with technical and navigational abilities, for long space flights we may need the help of alien Medics."
