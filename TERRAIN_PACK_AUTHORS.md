Notes:
* All of these terrains reuse and adapt the tilesets and artwork of the original XCOM and TFTD games terrains. It is impossible to provide in detail. the use/changes made to the tilesets (.MCD/.PCK/.TAB files) but the list specifies the terrains where original/additional artwork made by the authors was included. 
* Porting of UFO2000 original terrains to XCOM/UFO2000 required creating the necessary .RMP files for the AI to spawn and move the alien units.
* Porting UFO/TFTD terrains to UFO2000 mainly required creating the .lua map generation files.
* Combined terrains for OpenXCom was mostly done through OpenXCom map script rulesets, without changes done to the terrain's original files.
* Enlarged terrains are those with new map blocks (.MAP and .RMP files) designed and added to the original version.
* Hobbes' XCOM and UFO2000 terrains were hosted at http://area51.xcomufo.com, the offline version can be consulted through this address at the Internet Wayback Machine. The original site files have been all included in the pack, in the Original Files folder. Several of those mods are still available to download at Strategycore.co.uk (http://www.strategycore.co.uk/forums/topic/9389-ufo-terrain-mod/).
