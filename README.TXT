About this mod:
My Personal approach on creating a sort of LONG WAR MOD for the ORIGNAL UFO - DEFENSE.

I originally created it as a player torture device *evilgrin*, but it turned out to be a Mod people like to play because of the challenge it offers.
When designing this Mod, I decided to stick on the CORE VANILLA GAME PRINCIPLES and create basically a EXPANSION PACK.

It offers a much better Research Tree, a Economy were you need money desperately, where you will face difficult decisions and set backs during your campaign.
Earth itself has been receiving a major update with a updated and more fine tuned globa map with 340+ cities and 12 added additional Bioomes and 65+ new terrains and even more terrain combinations.
The Alien also gained a few new UFO types, which they use on missions, additionaly all vanilla UFO's received a set of internal configurations, to make fights on UFO missions more tactically challenging.
Alien Bases play a much bigger role during the campaign and a extended Map set and Upgrading Size over time has been added.
All this has been enriched with a lot of additional Weapons, Drones and Tanks for Xcom and Aliens and als New or Advanced Alien Units and Species.
There are repair and upgrade options for Armors, Drones and Tanks if you desire todo so.

Enemies and Combat Situations, which will give you a Nightmare during your dreams (at least I hope so, *grin*).
Its a LONG WAR to free earth (INGAME TIME: 15-17+ Months). So are you ready for the ride?

The mod should be PLAYABLE under ALL DIFFICULTY LEVELS, due to the balanced economy.
For FULL EXPERIENCE pick the preselected SUPERHUMAN DIFFICULTY ;)

This mod is aimed at experienced X-Com players, who know the game well and are not afraid of a DIFFICULTY HIGHER then SUPERHUMAN.

Some general advice when playing:

	- For ALIEN CONTAINMENT and ALIVE INTERROGATIONS raid the Alien Base in your starting region, you need to kill/stun all enemies for success
	- Unlocking LASER WEAPONS needs ALIVE INTERROGATIONS and ALIEN DATA SLATE (located on Labships)
	- Unlocking PLASMA WEAPONS and ADVANCED ALIEN EXPLOSIVES needs ALIVE INTERROGATIONS and ALIEN DATA CORE (located on Battleships)
	- Researching CRAFTS, Advanced HWPs, Advanced Soldier Armors requires ALIVE INTERROGATIONS (Alive Alien: Medics, Navigator, Engineers)
	- ALIVE INTERROGATIONS will trigger Alien missions
	- ALIEN BASES on earth will trigger missions on their own (keep their number in check or you will get outpaced!)
	- It is strongly recommended to get LASERS before MUTONS arrive in June and getting PLASMA WEAPONS will help greatly against MUTON ELITES and other advanced species
	- It is recommended to Reach the number of at least 100 SCIENTISTS by APRIL and around 250 SCIENTISTS by NOVEMBER of first ingame year
	- RESEARCH is a huge COST INVESTMENT, plan accordingly with your finances
	- Get used to manage and maintain at least 2 TO 3 ASSAULT TEAMS, by July (you can get more no problem)
	- RADAR BASES are needed especially in the BEGINNING (stick with a simple Small Radar, its cheap, or whatever you can efford)
	- RETALIATORs or optimal for shooting down TERROR SHIP, I recommend using at least 3 with Dual Laser cannons or Avalanche Misseles
	- Get a SKYSTRIKER ASAP, its just the better Skyranger ;)
	- Familerise yourself with the ADVANCED MOVEMENT OPTIONS
	- Be WARNED about MELEE TERROR UNITS, they will ignore dangers in their way towards your units and they will CHARGE at you!
	- For unlocking the FINAL MISSION a ETHEREAL COMMANDER is needed
	- The DIFFICULTY will be actually far HIGHER then SUPERHUMAN, considering the changes in economy and research (even for lower difficulty levels)
	- PLAY IRONMAN!! (Please enforce your own Ironman, having only one savegame for such a big mod, where bugs may happen is kinda a bad thing ok?)

However your run goes, let me know your FEEDBACK and how i can IMPROVE the MOD further.
For a detailed list of changes (may contain spoilers) see the Features further down.
